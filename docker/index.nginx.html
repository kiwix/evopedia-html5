<!-- This file will be used by dockerfile-moz-extension to provide a redirect from the server's html directory to
    the implementation. This is a convenience to any user who may visit the root of the server. However, note that
    this is out of the scope of the Service Worker in the implementation's subdirectory, so this redirect will only
    work if the client is online. The client will only be able to access the implementation OFFLINE if the browser
    is pointed to <domain>/current/ or <domain>/current/www/index.html (or equivalent in a versioned directory).
    The browser extension should always be pointed to the full path of the index.html to be loaded in SW mode.
