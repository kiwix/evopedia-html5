We have plans to enable this format, but there are considerable technical challenges to overcome in order to display these archives with the fidelity that you expect from Kiwix -- see <a href=\"https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-js/issues/1009\" target=\"_blank\">issue #1009&nbsp;<img src=\"img/Icon_External_Link.png\" /></a>. <b>However, there is <i>experimental</i> support for Zimit archives in our PWA at <a href=\"https://pwa.kiwix.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://pwa.kiwix.org&nbsp;<img src=\"img/Icon_External_Link.png\" /></a></b>.",

You can use an open-source BitTorrent client such as <a href=\"https://www.qbittorrent.org/\" target=\"_blank\">QBittorrent&nbsp;<img src=\"img/Icon_External_Link.png\" /></a> with these links (install the software before clicking on the torrent link).",
      "about-large-archives-para2": "If you need to store a large ZIM archive on an older filesystem formatted as FAT16 or FAT32, you need to be aware of the file size limits of those systems (FAT16 &lt; 2GiB; FAT32 &lt; 4GiB). Most modern microSD cards, thumb drives or hard drives are formatted as exFAT or another modern FS such as NTFS, which do not have this issue. If your ZIM archive is larger than the FS limit, it is possible to split the archive into several 2GiB-1 or 4GiB-1 files (or smaller). You will need to give a file extension to each chunk in the right order following this pattern: <code>*.zimaa</code>, <code>*.zimab</code>, <code>*.zimac</code>, <code>...</code>, etc.). When you pick this archive in the app, be sure to pick <b>all</b> the chunks, or drag-and-drop them all into the app.",
