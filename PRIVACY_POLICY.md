# Kiwix JS Privacy Policy

## Short version

Kiwix JS works offline, and does not collect or record any of your personal data. It only remembers
your browsing history for the duration of a session (for the purpose of returning to previously
viewed pages). This history is lost on exiting the app and is not recorded in any way.

## Longer version

This application only reads the archive files that you explicitly select on your device together
with files in its own package. Some ZIM archives contain active content (scripts) which may, in
rare circumstances, attempt to contact external servers for incidental files such as fonts.
These scripts will only run if you enable Service Worker mode in Configuration. Nevertheless, if
you believe your Internet access is insecure, or is being observed or censored, we recommend
that you completely shut down your Internet (Data or WiFi) access before using the application.

Additionally, if you obtained this app from a vendor Store (including extensions), then the Store
operator may track your usage of the app (e.g. download, install, uninstall, date and number of
sessions) for the purpose of providing anonymous, aggregate usage statistics to developers. If
this concerns you, you should check the relevant Store Privacy Policy for further information.
